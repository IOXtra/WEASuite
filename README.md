# 🧰 WEASuite™ — Create → Build → Publish

**WEASuite™** is the graphical and CLI built on [**WEAStack™**](../../../WEAStack), combining writing, note-taking, research, and web publishing into one environment.

Whether you’re a **student**, **writer**, or **developer**, WEASuite™ turns complex publishing workflows into a single, offline-first flow.

---

## 🧭 Workflow

1. **Create** — Notes, essays, code, or design in Markdown  
2. **Build** — Preview locally with full Cloudflare style emulation  
3. **Publish** — Export to PDF or deploy to the web (Cloudflare, GitHub, S3)

---
